Package Overview
================

Interacting with `SingStat.gov.sg`_'s API is done through a client.

.. _SingStat.gov.sg: https://www.singstat.gov.sg

This client contains several public functions, one function per endpoint. A function's name is the same as its corresponding endpoint's ending path.

Most functions accept named arguments, where an argument corresponds with a parameter that the endpoint accepts.
